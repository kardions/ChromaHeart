Themes/Tropes/Ideas I Enjoy in VNs
     Dating sim
     Puzzles 
     Studying people/learning about characters
     Choice
     Dystopian 
     When there's a twist and/or when characters have a dark secret
          I.e. Miranda in Monster Prom isn't the sweet little princess we think she is, but a ruler hell-bent on subjugating everyone who crosses her… or just subjugating everyone lol. Rules with an iron fist
     Intelligent humour and pop culture references
     Breaking the 4th wall, but in moderation 

Character ideas:
     Character who uses sign language to communicate
     Idle/standard pose: love sign
     Joy/sad/anger: sign matches emotion

     Character with synesthesia?
     ADHD?
     Depersonalization? 


General Ideas
     Conflict
          mom enjoys conflict with context
     Story is character-driven 
     Choice
          Giving the player choice & power 
          Choices matter and influence dialogue 
     Opportunities to befriend instead of romance (throughout game)
     Escaping over a wall
          Like escape from current reality to a potentially brighter future
          Physical and figurative
